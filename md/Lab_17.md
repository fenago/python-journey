### Installing Python libraries using pip and venv



If you need a third-party module that isn't prepackaged for your
platform, you'll have to turn to its source distribution. This fact
presents a couple of problems:


-   [To install the module, you must find and download it.]
-   [Installing even a single Python module correctly can involve a
    certain amount of hassle in dealing with Python's paths and your
    system's permissions, which makes a standard installation system
    helpful.]


Python offers [pip] as the current solution to both problems.
[pip] tries to find the module in the Python Package index (more
about that soon), downloads it and any dependencies, and takes care of
the installation. The basic syntax of [pip] is quite simple. To
install the popular requests library from the command line, for example,
all you have to do is



```
$ python3 -m pip install requests
```




Upgrading to the library's latest version requires only the addition of
the [---upgrade] switch:



```
$ python3 -m pip install â€“-upgrade requests
```




Finally, if you need to specify a particular version of a package, you
can append it to the name like this:



```
$ python3 -m pip install requests==2.11.1
$ python3 -m pip install requests>=2.9
```




#### Installing with the --user flag



On
many occasions, you can't or don't want to install a Python package in
the main system instance of Python. Maybe you need a bleeding-edge
version of the library, but some other application (or the system
itself) still uses an older version. Or maybe you don't have access
privileges to modify the system's default Python. In cases like those,
one answer is to install the library with the [---user] flag. This
flag installs the library in the user's home directory, where it's not
accessible by any other users. To install [requests] for only the
local user:



```
$ python3 -m pip install --user requests
```




As I mentioned previously, this scheme is particularly useful if you're
working on a system on which you don't have sufficient administrator
rights to install software, or if you want to install a different
version of a module. If your needs go beyond the basic installation
methods discussed here, a good place to start is "Installing Python
Modules," which you can find in the Python documentation.



#### Virtual environments



You have another, better option if you need to avoid installing
libraries in the system Python. This option is called a virtual
environment (virtualenv). A *virtual environment* is a self-contained
directory structure that contains both an installation of Python and its
additional packages. Because the entire Python environment is contained
in the virtual environment, the libraries and modules installed there
can't conflict with those in the main system or in other virtual
environments, allowing different applications to use different versions
on both Python and its packages.



Creating and using a virtual environment takes two steps. First, you
create the environment:



```
$ python3 -m venv test-env
```




This step creates the environment with Python and [pip] installed
in a directory called test-env. Then, when the environment is created,
you activate it. On Windows, you do this:



```
> test-env\Scripts\activate.bat
```




On Unix or MacOS systems, you source the activate script:



```
$ source test-env/bin/activate
```




When you've activated the environment, you can use [pip] to manage
packages as earlier, but in the virtual environment [pip] is a
standalone command:



```
$ pip install requests
```




In addition, whatever version
of Python you used to create the environment is the default Python for
that environment, so you can use just [python] instead of
[python3] or [python3.6].



Virtual environments are very useful for managing projects and their
dependencies and are very much a standard practice, particularly for
developers working on multiple projects. For more information, look at
the "[Virtual Environments and
Packages]"
section of the Python tutorial in the Python online documentation.




### Summary


-   [Python has a rich standard library that covers more common
    situations than many other languages, and you should check what's in
    the standard library carefully before looking for external
    modules.]
-   [If you do need an external module, prebuilt packages for your
    operating system are the easiest option, but they're sometimes older
    and often hard to find.]
-   [The standard way to install from source is to use pip, and the best
    way to prevent conflicts among multiple projects is to create
    virtual environments with the venv module.]
-   [Usually, the logical first step in searching for external modules
    is the Python Package Index (PyPI).]
